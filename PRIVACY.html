<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Our Policies Concerning Children</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our Services are not directed at children under the age of 13 (or under the age of 16 in European Countries, collectively ‘Children’). Children are not permitted to use our Services, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from them. For games that are not directed at Children but nonetheless may appeal to them, we take additional steps to limit access to these Services based on the player or user’s age. Though our Services do not target Children, we may collect age information before allowing a player or user to proceed for certain games.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you want to be a player or user for our Services as Children, please ask your parent(s) or guardian(s) for permission before using or playing on the Service. If you have not obtained permission from your parent(s) or guardian(s), you should not use our Service.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Children have provided us with the personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@cookapps.com"><span class="s3">cs@c4fgames.com</span></a>. If we become aware that we have collected the personal information from Children without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our records.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Changes to our Privacy Policy</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy. If we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by placing a notice in-game or on our Websites at http://c4fgames.com for you before the change becomes effective.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If required by law, we will ask for your consent regarding such change. The most current version of the Privacy Policy will govern our processing of your information and will be available at http://c4fgames.com where you might want to periodically check for updates of this Privacy Policy.   </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For previous versions of this Privacy Policy, please contact us via cs@c4fgames.com.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Your continued use of the Service will signify your acceptance of these changes.</span></p>
